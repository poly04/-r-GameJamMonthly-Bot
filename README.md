There is missing one file, Config.py, that contains credentials used for loggin into Reddit via /u/GameJamBot
That file is required, but it's easy to create one yourself.

Dependencies:  
    -praw  
    -lxml  
    -selenium
  
You'll also need Microsoft's Edge browser, and a driver that lets selenium open it.

NOTE: If you come across any bugs, you can PM /u/TheFanne on Reddit.
